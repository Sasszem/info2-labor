            <p>A QSL card is a written confirmation of either a two-way radiocommunication between two amateur radio or citizens band stations; a one-way reception of a signal from an AM radio, FM radio, television or shortwave broadcasting station; or the reception of a two-way radiocommunication by a third party listener. A typical QSL card is the same size and made from the same material as a typical postcard, and most are sent through the mail as such.</p>

            In Q6K, you can send and receive QSLs to/from other registered users. Start by going QSOs>Own QSOs, then you'll see a plus sign next to the QSOs where you can send a QSL. You can upload an image to send. After sending a QSL, you'll see an image icon next to the QSOs that has a sent / incoming QSL. The other side can acknowledge the QSL by clicking a button, and you'll see the status on the QSO page.
            Also, you can list all your <a href="/qsl/inbox" class="btn btn-secondary">incoming QSLs</a> or <a href="/qsl/sent" class="btn btn-secondary">sent QSLs</a>
